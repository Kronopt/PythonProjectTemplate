# PythonProjectTemplate
Python Project Template/Skeleton

The objective of this repository is to have all the files,
folders and style conventions that are usually part of a standard python project in a single location,
akin to a checklist.

Some things might not make sense for every project, but overall the most import elements are here.

I created this template for my own personal use, but feel free to use it.

Just copy the ```Project``` folder to start a new python project.
