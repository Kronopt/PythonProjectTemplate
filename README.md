# PythonProjectTemplate
Python Project Template/Skeleton

The objective of this repository is to have all the files, folders and style conventions that are usualy part of a standard python project on a single location.

I created this template for my own personal use, but feel free to use it.

Just copy the ```Project``` folder to start a new python project.


## TODO
* README
* docs/
* .pylintrc
* setup.py
* check github for other files to add
* check other repos for stuff to put here
* check my other projects for docstrings and code
